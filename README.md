Super After World
Where do your Marios go when they die? To the Super After World. 

When I was a kid I was obsessed with where my fallen Marios went after they died. I imagined them going to an alternate world where they all collected and lived together. This is also the same place that missing socks go. And maybe you.

------

node.js script to serve all assets
will later on provide websocket to allow for mario's body
to transcend after it's death

--------------
the after world
mario bodies enter the world through green tube on top
bos2d physics computes their coordinates, so that they pile up
players' names should be attached to each body
bodies should vary in color / style so that it looks even more messy
background:
2d game reminiscent
maybe clowd parallax effect
