Super After World


web.js
------

node.js script to serve all assets
will later on provide websocket to allow for mario's body
to transcend after it's death


index.html
----------
the game itself
stolen from http://processingjs.nihongoresources.com/test/PjsGameEngine/docs/tutorial/mario.html


afterlife.html
--------------
the after world
mario bodies enter the world through green tube on top
bos2d physics computes their coordinates, so that they pile up
players' names should be attached to each body
bodies should vary in color / style so that it looks even more messy
background:
2d game reminiscent
maybe clowd parallax effect
